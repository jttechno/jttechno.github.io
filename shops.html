    <li>Finding a local store can play a huge role in a surfing trip. It doesnt necessarily need to be a surfshop, conveinience stores carry products that can help you out in a bind. For example if you have a soft top board and you accidentaly punctured it you could run over to the store and buy some tape as a temporary fix.</li>
    <li>get a sleeve fro you surfboard. If you carry your board on the inside it can protect the cloth or leather seats. If you carry your board on the outside it canprotct the paint.</li>
    <li>Don't act tough. If you are feeling cold it is a good idea to hop out. frostbite is dangerous hurtful and can get the best and the worst surfers if not taken seriously.</li>
    <li>Wear a wetsuit. Even if your have a high tolerence to cold, a wetsuit can keep you warmer which can lead to longer more enjoyabel surf sessions.</li>
